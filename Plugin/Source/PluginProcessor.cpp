     * Rate is linear in hertz, not exponential: 1.79 Hz at zero and about 0.089 Hz a unit,

     * reads zero until it is touched, and a continuous controller now spreads its 128 steps
     * across the useful range instead of half of them over a dead zone.

/*
 * WHAT A SAVED PROJECT CARRIES
 *
 * The whole disk, not a path to it.
 *
 * A path is smaller and it is what most plugins store, and it breaks: the library gets
 * moved or renamed, the project goes to somebody else, the drive letter changes, and the
 * song opens silent. For a sampler that is worse than for most plugins, because the sound
 * IS the disk - there is nothing to fall back on.
 *
 * An S950 floppy is 800 x 1024 bytes. Compressed and encoded it comes to a few hundred
 * kilobytes inside the project, which is nothing beside the audio a session already holds,
 * and it means a saved song can never lose the sound it was made with - on this machine or
 * any other.
 *
 * The sectors are stored rather than the .hfe they may have arrived in: decoding is
 * deterministic and one way, so keeping the result means reopening does no MFM work and
 * cannot come out differently from the day it was saved.
