/*
 * The plugin's window.
 *
 * Deliberately almost nothing: a gain slider, what is loaded, and how many voices are
 * sounding. The editor that matters is AkaiS950Studio, which is where disks are opened and
 * keygroups are edited; this is what a host needs to show while the instrument plays.
 *
 * The voice count is here because it answers the first question anyone asks of a plugin
 * that is not making a sound - is it getting the notes? - without a debugger.

/*
 * An ADSR drawn as its own shape, with the corners dragged.
 *
 * Four numbers on four knobs is a poor way to see an envelope: the thing you are actually
 * adjusting is a shape, and a shape is what this shows. Drag the first corner for attack,
 * the second for decay and sustain together, the last for release.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRAWS, GIVEN THAT THE CONTROLS ARE OFFSETS
 *
 * The parameters behind this are trims - they shift every keygroup in the programme at
 * once - so there is no single envelope they describe. What is drawn is therefore the
 * RESULT for one representative keygroup: the programme's own values with the trim added.
 * Dragging moves the trim by however much that keygroup would have to move, and every other
 * keygroup goes with it. So the shape is honest about what you will hear from that keygroup
 * and approximate for the rest, which is the best a single picture can be.
 *
 * The horizontal axis is the panel's 0..99 for each stage, not seconds. The machine's
 * envelope times are exponential - a stored 80 is nearly two seconds where 40 is thirty
 * milliseconds - so drawing them to scale would leave every short envelope invisible in the
 * corner. This way each stage's corner moves evenly under the mouse, which is what a control
 * should do.
