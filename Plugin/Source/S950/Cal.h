     *
     * Nine settings, measured on the filter envelope where a moving cutoff can be watched all
     * the way down a fourteen-second note. Attack, decay and release are three separate

     * Measured twice over, because the analysis has a bias of its own - a window averages the

     * through the same analysis, where the answer is known. The first pass used a model that
     * was out by up to 2x, so its biases were taken at the wrong sweep rates; adopting its
     * table and measuring again moved every point by less than 8%. A third pass against THIS
     * table reads every setting back at 0.95 to 1.04 of it, and the points oscillate rather
     * than drift - so what is left is the measurement's own repeatability and not an error
     * still to be chased.
     *
     * Stored 50 only appears at all on the second pass: under the old curve the render was
     * over inside one analysis window, so there was nothing to take a bias from.
     *
     * The VCA decay confirms it independently, from the same take and a different envelope:
     * measured against a fixed depth it gives 3.96 s at stored 85 against this table's 4.04,
     * and 8.49 s at stored 95 against 8.09.

     * - but it is the one point a second take should be asked about first.
     *
     * THE ENDS ARE EXTRAPOLATED, NOT MEASURED

     * Nothing reaches below 50 or above 95: the fast end is over inside one analysis window
     * and the slow end outlasts a note. Both ends continue at the slope fitted across every
     * measured point, which is the best that can honestly be said of them. Extrapolating from
     * the two nearest points instead put stored 0 at 320 ms, which every percussive sample in

     * keygroup is flat at velocity 1 and bends 298 cents at 127. That decides how 22 real
     * keygroups sound: the ones setting byte 13 with byte 12 left at 0.

     * WHERE A KEY SITS IN AN OVERLAP
     *
     *     x = (i + 1) / (N + 1)     i the 0-based key within the overlap, N its width
     *

     * obvious i/(N-1): seven widths from 1 key to 21 were measured, and wherever two land on
     * the same x they agree to 0.1 dB - x = 0.14 reads -0.4 at widths 13 and 21, x = 0.67
     * reads -8.7 at widths 2, 5 and 21. And a ONE-KEY overlap, which 13 library pairs have,
     * sits at x = 1/2 and splits evenly at -4.5 dB, where i/(N-1) divides by zero.
     *
     * THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS TABLE WAS MEASURED THROUGH A LIMITER AND WAS WRONG. Every
     * calibration take up to run 17 was recorded with 20-30% of its samples pinned within
     * 0.1 dB of -0.49 dBFS. The crossfade is the one TWO-TONE measurement in the rig, and

     * strong one is dragged down by the strong one's gain reduction, so the error grows as
     * the tones become unequal - towards the edges of the overlap. The old readings were out
     * by 0.2 dB at x = 0.1, 1.5 dB at x = 0.5 and 6.1 dB at x = 0.9, and gave
     * cos(pi x / 2) ^ 1.44 with the pair dipping 1.3 dB at the midpoint. "No standard
     * crossfade does that" was written down at run 15 and treated as a curiosity. It was the
     * limiter.
     *
     * Clean, the pair conserves power to 0.1 dB.
     *
     * A TABLE RATHER THAN A CURVE, AND NOW FOR A MEASURED REASON. Every distinct level in
     * the clean take is a whole number of 0.4 DECIBEL STEPS - eighteen of them, from 0 to
     * -28.0, landing on the grid to better than 0.1 dB:

     *
     * and 0.4 dB is the same unit run 19 measured for the SUSTAIN, at 0.400 dB per stored
     * unit. The machine counts decibels in 0.4 dB steps and the crossfade is a lookup of
     * that count, so no smooth function can be right in detail.
     *
     * WIDTH 9 DISAGREES AT ITS LAST KEY, and it survived the re-record: x = 0.9 reads -17.6
     * where width 13 at 0.929 and width 21 at 0.909 both read -21.6. Four decibels, against
     * the 0.1 the rest agree to. With the gain quantised that is what you would expect - two
     * (i, N) pairs landing on nearby x can still fall on different integer steps - so the
     * real rule is arithmetic on i and N rather than a function of x, and nobody has worked
     * it out. Both points are kept, so every measured width reproduces its own reading.
     *
     * x = 0 and x = 1 are extrapolations, reached only by overlaps wider than 21 keys: x

     * summing to +2.3, identical to the decimal across both takes, with its ceiling moving
     * down by exactly the 2.66 dB the input had. A ceiling that scales with the recording
     * gain is UPSTREAM of it. The S950 is distorting its own output and no recording level
     * will ever fix it.
     *
     * That fact is the measurement. Two equal sources at L dB relative to one of them alone
     * sum to 3.01 + L, and any compressive distortion can only REDUCE what the pair measures
     * - intermodulation lands away from either tone's bin, never in it. So the measured sum

     *
     * So identical ranges are NOT faded: no lower keygroup and no upper one, nothing to fade
     * across, so the machine simply layers them - which is exactly why two full-level voices
     * overflow its output and it saturates. 17 library pairs are this, the ARP2600 layers,
     * and they have been playing 3.7 dB too quiet apiece.
     *
     * MEASURED DIRECTLY IN RUN 20, and it is zero to the tenth of a decibel. That run put
     * both keygroups AND both solo references on a zone loudness of -40, which is 16 dB of

     *   THE MULTIPLIER is 2, not 1. Depth 25 swings the byte from 20 to 99, not 45 to 95.
     *   Fitted freely it is 2.05; 1.5 and 2.5 are both far worse.
     *
     * The control passes: depth 0 reads 1366 ms at velocity 1 and 1354 ms at 127, so the
     * enable bit alone does nothing.
     *
     * WITH THE SWITCH OFF, EVERY NOTE IS RELEASED AS THOUGH ITS VELOCITY WERE 1. That is
     * measured, and it is why this parameter looked inert for two runs: run 7 had bit 0x10
     * clear on every keygroup, as do all 1908 in the real library, and read the same release
     * at velocity 1 and 127 for depths of -50, 0 and +50. Those readings are what this rule
     * gives at velocity 1 - -50 clamps to 99 and takes eleven seconds, +50 clamps to 0 and is
     * instant. Only the two extremes were tried with the switch off, so "treated as velocity
     * 1" is the simplest thing that fits, not the only one.
