     * WHY THE PATCH CHANGES HANDS THIS WAY
     *
     * The C# simply assigned a reference and let the garbage collector work out when the old
     * programme could go. There is no collector here, and the two obvious replacements are
     * both wrong in the same place:
     *
     *   - An atomic<Patch*> leaks, or frees while a voice is halfway through a sample.
     *   - A shared_ptr read on the audio thread copies, which touches a reference count and,
     *     if that copy turns out to be the last, frees every sample buffer in the programme
     *     inside the audio callback. That is a dropout waiting for the worst moment.
     *
     * So the pointer is moved, never copied, and only ever in one direction at a time. The
     * message thread puts a patch in `pending`; the audio thread moves it into `audioPatch`
     * and moves what was there into `retired`; the message thread takes `retired` away and
     * destroys it. Moving a shared_ptr touches no reference count and allocates nothing, so
     * the audio thread's half costs two pointer swaps.
     *
     * The audio thread declines to take a new patch while a retired one is still waiting to
     * be collected. That means a second programme change before the host's message thread
     * has run is simply held until it has - a programme arriving a few milliseconds late
     * being the whole cost of never freeing on the wrong thread.
