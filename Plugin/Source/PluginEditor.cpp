 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE PLUGIN'S STATE
 *
 * A plugin's state travels with the song. A folder saved there would come back weeks
 * later, in somebody else's session, as an answer to a question nobody had asked - and an
 * instance freshly added to a new project would have no answer at all, which is exactly
 * the case where being sent to the right shelf matters most. So it lives in the plugin's
 * own settings file instead, beside the machine's other application data, where every
 * instance in every host shares the one answer.
 *
 * The file is opened for each read and each write rather than held. This happens when
 * somebody clicks a button, not in any loop, and two instances writing it at once means
 * the later one wins - which for "the last folder" is the right answer anyway.
