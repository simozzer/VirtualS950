<#
    Build the plugin, after proving the engine against the C# reference.

        .\build.ps1              conformance check, then the VST3 and the standalone
        .\build.ps1 -NoRun       compile the conformance check but do not run it
        .\build.ps1 -NoPlugin    conformance check only, for iterating on the engine

    IT USED TO BUILD ONLY THE CONFORMANCE CHECK, AND SAID "ok" WHILE THE PLUGIN WENT STALE

    That is the worst shape a build script can have. It compiles three files - the check
    itself, Voice.cpp and Engine.cpp - runs them, prints a green line and exits, and none
    of that touches the VST3. The plugin is a CMake build, and unless someone remembered
    to run CMake separately the .vst3 on disk stayed whatever it was.

    It caught us out twice. The second time the plugin was eleven hours behind the engine,
    across the whole velocity-to-attack and velocity-to-release work, with this script
    reporting success every time it ran. Nothing in the output hinted at it, because from
    the script's point of view nothing was wrong.

    So the conformance check now gates the plugin build rather than standing in for it: if
    the engine does not match the C# to nine decimal places, there is no point compiling a
    plugin around it, and if it does then the plugin is built from those exact sources in
    the same breath. -NoPlugin is there for the tight loop where only the engine is moving.

    WHY VCVARS AND NOT JUST "cl"

    cl.exe is never on the PATH. The installer leaves it off on purpose, because the
    compiler needs INCLUDE, LIB and PATH set for one particular target architecture, and
    vcvars64.bat is what sets them. Start menu -> "Developer PowerShell for VS 2026" does
    the same thing; this finds the batch file itself so the build works from any shell,
    including one driven by a script.

    vswhere reports where Visual Studio is rather than a path being written down here,
    because that path carries the edition and the major version in it - C:\Program Files\
    Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community today - and hard-coding it would break on the
    next upgrade with an error that says nothing useful.

    CMake, because JUCE is a CMake project and the .vst3 is assembled by it - a bundle of
    a directory, a moduleinfo.json and the binary, not just a compile.

    cmake is looked for on the PATH first and inside Visual Studio second. VS ships one at
    a path that carries the edition and major version, which is exactly the kind of thing
    vswhere exists to avoid writing down, so $vsPath from above is reused rather than
