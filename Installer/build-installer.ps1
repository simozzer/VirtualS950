        .\build-installer.ps1              build everything, then the installer
        .\build-installer.ps1 -SkipBuild   package whatever is already built
        .\build-installer.ps1 -CheckOnly   just say whether the pieces are there

    The order matters: the editor and the plugin are built from source, every file the
    Inno script names is checked to exist, and only then is the installer compiled. A
    packaging step that silently ships a stale binary - or quietly omits one - is worse
    than one that fails.

    Did a build step do what it promised?

    Not "$LASTEXITCODE -ne 0" on its own, which is what this used to ask. That variable is
    only ever set by a NATIVE command, and build-icon.ps1 ends on Write-Host - so in a shell
    where nothing native has run yet it is still $null, and $null -ne 0 is TRUE. The release
    build then stopped with "the icon did not build" immediately after printing the size of
    the icon it had just built. It passed only when some earlier command happened to leave a
    zero lying around, which is not a thing to rest a release on.

    So: the exit code when there actually is one, and then the artefact, which is the part
    that cannot be faked by a stale variable. $ErrorActionPreference is Stop, so anything
    that throws inside the called script has already taken us out before this runs.
