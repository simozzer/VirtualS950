    Build the Studio application.

        .\build.ps1                 builds AkaiS950Studio.exe beside this script
        .\build.ps1 -Run            builds it and starts it
        .\build.ps1 -Out somewhere\ builds it there instead

    WHY csc AND NOT dotnet build

    There is no .NET SDK on the machine this was written on - only runtimes - so
    `dotnet build` has nothing to build with, and the csproj files are there for an IDE
    rather than for this. csc.exe from .NET Framework 4.0 is on every Windows install
    since about 2010 and needs nothing fetched, which suits a project whose whole point
    is that it has no dependencies.

    The cost is C# 5: no string interpolation, no expression-bodied members, no nameof.
    The source is written to that, deliberately.
